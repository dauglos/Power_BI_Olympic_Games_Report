# Power_BI_Olympic_Games_Report
Data Analysis practice project. Analysing and reporting data on the Olympic games  (1896-2016).

This project is heavily inspired by Ali Ahmad's portfolio for begginer's youtube video. Despite following most of the video's steps, I have formatted and modified some entries so that I would know the tool even better. Aditionally, I have included one more tab containing analyses which I decided to explore on my own to enrichen the report.

Dataset too big and can't be uploaded on Github:
